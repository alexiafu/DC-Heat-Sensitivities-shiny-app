<p>#APP Title: City Water Exploration</p>
<p>#Team members: Karl von Zabern - DATA 613-001 ChihChin Yang - DATA
613-001 SzuWei Fu - DATA 613-001 Evan Bowman - DATA 613-001</p>
<p>#Topic and Data: This is an initial exploration of a data set put
together by researchers at the Nature Conservancy published by McDonald
et al. (2011). This project will make these data more accessible to
researchers, policymakers, civil society actors, and more by creating an
interface that will allow them to analyze data related to water based on
different units of analysis. These data are extremely useful for better
understanding the ways in which water resource stress exists in
different locations, and how that stress manifests in varying water
infrastructure projects globally. Furthermore, we will visualize data to
prepare for econometric modeling.</p>
<p>This data set shows over 1,500 water intake locations from the first
global survey of the water sources of over 500 large cities. The data
set was created and published by Rob McDonald and The Nature Conservancy
from research on water utilities and their annual reports. For each
intake location, spatial location was recorded. The locations were
recorded as accurately as possible, and freshwater withdrawal points
were adjusted to match the underlying hydrographic river system. Some
intake points serve multiple water utilities and cities. Resource Watch
shows only a subset of the data set.</p>
<pre><code>The literature on water scarcity related to climate change has long been concerned that climate change will drive political struggles over down stream and upstream users ().</code></pre>
<p>#Proposed data sources: The data used for this shiny app will come
from the McDonald et al. 2014 paper. This data set shows over 1,500
water intake locations from the first global survey of the water sources
of over 500 large cities. The data set was created and published by Rob
McDonald and The Nature Conservancy from research on water utilities and
their annual reports. For each intake location, spatial location was
recorded. The locations were recorded as accurately as possible, and
freshwater withdrawal points were adjusted to match the underlying
hydrographic river system. Some intake points serve multiple water
utilities and cities. The data is from WaterGAP to assess water
availability of water from time series climatic data.</p>
<p>The data is intended to give users the ability to understand three
components of water access: water availability, water quality, and
delivery. Water availability refers purely to the amount of water
physically available to a city. This measure informs the overall level
of water stress by city. This measure does not account for the quality
of water sources nor mechanisms for water delivery.</p>
<p>#Literature review: McDonald, R. I., Weber, K., Padowski, J., Flörke,
M., Schneider, C., Green, P. A., … &amp; Montgomery, M. (2014). Water on
an urban planet: Urbanization and the reach of urban water
infrastructure. Global environmental change, 27, 96-105.</p>
<p>#Actor/Audience Description: This App may tend best to city
government officials and policy makers. They will be able to see which
locations need more resources based on the map and statistical
analysis.</p>
<p>#Fixed or Dynamic Data: The data for this project is fixed. Data
collection for this projects came from decentralized sources and
therefore required a large amount of labor to put into a cohesive,
comparable format.</p>
<p>#Questions of Interest: 1. What is the water source distributed in
the global city? 2. Compare water source from developed and not
developed city 3. What is the size of water used from urban instructure
around the world and the percentage of water used from earth
surface?</p>
<p>#General Layout: We will have 1 tab for an interactive map that will
allow users to manipulate what variable they want to see and. Another
tab will have tables for statistical analysis and summary, which users
will be able to select which variable they want to analyze. The last tab
will contain the sampled data.</p>
<p>#APP Theme: We will use the Cosmo theme from Bootswatch.</p>
<p>#Ethics review: Data from Nature Conservancy published by McDonald et
al. (2011) does not warranty the completeness, accuracy, content, or
fitness for any particular purpose”. We as the app developers, are not
liable for any deficiencies in the completeness, accuracy, content, or
fitness for any particular purpose or use of the public data set. Since
our app uses data from Nature Conservancy published by McDonald et
al. (2011), we need to pass this message onto the users.</p>
<p>#Jobs: We segmented certain tasks among the group, but we will work
with each other if additional help is needed. Karl von Zaborn:
Literature review, Shiny coding-map tab ChihChin Yang: Data cleaning,
Shiny coding-statistics tab SzuWei Fu: Data cleaning, Shiny
coding-statistics tab Evan Bowman: Shiny coding-map tab, vignette</p>
<p>We will collaborate and communicate over Zoom and WhatsApp.Regarding
branching, each person will have their own branch. 1 person will push
the main branch when we have a group meeting and we can merge to pull
the latest submission/push.</p>
<p>#Schedule: Data Cleaning and exploration and Peer Review: 11/1 Data
manipulation and shiny structure and Prog Report: 11/8 Rough draft of
app and Vignette: 11/15 Rehearsals: 11/29 Push to GitHub:12/6</p>
